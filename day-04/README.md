## Problem

There are `numBottles` water bottles that are initially full of water. You can exchange `numExchange` empty water bottles from the market with one full water bottle.

The operation of drinking a full water bottle turns it into an empty bottle.

Given the two integers `numBottles` and `numExchange`, return the maximum number of water bottles you can drink.

-Problem 1 has `numBottles = 9` and `numExchange = 3`.

-Problem 2 has `numBottles = 15` and `numExchange = 4`
