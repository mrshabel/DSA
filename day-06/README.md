# Array Form Addition

The array-form of an integer `num` is an array representing its digits in left-to-right order.

For example, for `num = 1321`, the array form is `[1, 3, 2, 1]`.

Given `num`, the array-form of an integer, and an integer `k`, this program returns the array-form of the integer `num + k`.

Suppose `num = 1200` and `k = 34`, the program returns a list, `[1234]`
